\section*{Abstract}
% Some general comment on the reasons for the project
The availability of industrial machinery is crucial to any business operating in the manufacturing sector. Mechanical failures halt production and unplanned downtime is disruptive and costly. Small failures can lead to catastrophic failures which exponentially increases downtime and repair costs. Identifying a degradation condition before reaching catastrophic failure is key to maintaining machine availability. On the other hand, one does not want to waste resources performing maintenance when not required. For these reasons a large field of academic work is dedicated to analyzing the health of a machine, predicting it's remaining life and thus preventing failures.

% What the project is about
This thesis analyses a tube straightening machine used in the steel industry with the end goal of implementing a condition monitoring strategy. The data for this project comes from a real world application from a multinational manufacturer of steel products. It was obtained using the existing sensors and data acquisition system. The project serves as a study of the existing infrastructure (available sensors) and it's suitability for implementing a condition monitoring strategy. The work is the first step in a larger study and does not attempt to perform any implementation or fault identification. In a broad sense the aim of the project is to find relationships and patterns in the data that could be varying with time as the machine degrades.

% Outling of project steps
The data consists of twelve channels taken over a two week duration. It is prepossessed to isolate periods where the machine is operating and separated into cycles. Each of these is then further processed to extract time and frequency domain features. The features within each channel are compared with each other using the R\textsuperscript{2} coefficient of determination to find combinations that are correlated. A semi automated process is used to select the feature combinations. The same process is performed between signals for each feature. 

% The conclusions of the project
A number of linear regression models are created based on the results from the correlated features as well as some multivariate models. These are then compared using a FIT metric. Potential clustering of machine states are highlighted based on observations in the feature combinations. The conclusions drawn from this study include identification of relationships between signals, potential non-linear correlations and suggestions for future data collection and analysis going forward.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
% What is condition monitoring
Condition monitoring (\gls{CM}) is the process of predicting machine health through a combination of sensor data and software algorithms. Sensors measure parameters (vibration, temperature, acoustic emissions etc.) which provide inputs to an algorithm that outputs health metrics. This allows operators to gain an understanding of when a machine is likely to fail and instead perform some preventative interventions. The ability to monitor equipment health and predict remaining lifetime has valuable benefits. Avoiding unplanned downtime, especially catastrophic failures, allows the extraction of more value from existing resources and less disruption to production schedules.

% Discuss why CM is important
The application of \gls{CM} and \gls{PM} is a large area of research in the machine and manufacturing sector. Of course it is not only limited to machines, being utilized on other engineering structures like bridges ~\cite{buckley2023feature}, large process plants like in the oil and gas industry ~\cite{telford2011condition} and also biological systems ~\cite{tolocsi2011classification}. 
% Discuss more specifically bearing vibration analysis
A common application of \gls{CM} and \gls{PM} in manufacturing is the vibration analysis of rotating machines ~\cite{tiboni2022review, kateris2014machine}. Breakdowns in these types of machines are most commonly caused by failures in bearing subsystems. The degradation of a bearing results changes in the vibration signal, among others, which can be a indicator of bearing health. 

%Even more specifically a tube straightening machine
One such example of an industrial machine that uses roller bearings is a rotary tube straightening machine. These are used as a finishing process in the steel industry for the manufacturing of metal tubes. They are crucial for straightening the tube in the longitudinal direction and improving ovality of the product. 
% Explain why condition monitoring would be useful for a straightening machine
Straightening machines, like many other industrial machines, are expensive to procure and down time is costly. Performance may also be impacted by the machine being in poor condition and in need of maintenance. Thus it is in the interest of the operators to be able to schedule planned maintenance instead of having unplanned downtime and catastrophic failures.

% Challenges for CM
%Advantage of having access to this data
While there is a vast array of research around bearing vibration and \gls{CM}, all machines have their nuances so one \gls{CM} strategy is not necessarily suitable for all. No research specifically involving \gls{CM} on a straightening machine could be found. Unlike a simulation study, \gls{CM} requires real-world data which is not always readily available unless employed by the company owing the machine. This study assesses real world data from such a machine at a Swedish steel manufacturer, Alleima.

% Big Data -> What is Feature Extraction
One of the challenges in implementing \gls{CM} is that there are often huge amounts of data to process and sift through. Thus Feature extraction can be used to reduce the amount of the data whilst preserving the information. By analyzing the features one can then select the most relevant channels and reduce the dimensionality of the data by removing irrelevant, highly correlation or noisy signals. There exist many automated and non-automated methods to select the best features and is a current area of research. This study uses a semi-automated method using the R\textsuperscript{2} correlation coefficient to select the most appropriate features.

% Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to perform classification, i.e. data is labeled as normal or fault condition. Another difficulty with \gls{CM} research is the limited access to failure data meaning one is often forced to implement unsupervised learning methods. Often one only have partially labeled or totally unlabeled data and thus a different set of techniques exist for unsupervised learning. Here the data analysis is geared towards pattern recognition and clustering since no failure data is available to go with the data. This study has no access to fault or maintenance data and has the goal of trying to find patterns in the data, identify potential clustering opportunities and look at potential trends over time.

\subsection{Project Aim}
The aim of this project is to examine the existing data available for a tube straightening machine and make some observations as to whether it is possible to perform \gls{CM} and/or remaining life analysis for this machine. The first step is to analyze the available data that can be be attained using the existing sensors and data acquisition system. The end goal is to begin developing a strategy that will assist the company to know when the machine requires maintenance. The specific goals of this project are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand what signals are related to each other.
\item Understand the signals from a statistical point of view.
\item Calculate signal features and identify which are of significance and which are not useful for condition monitoring i.e. which features may represent degradation condition.
\item Combine appropriate features to create data models and identify trends.
\end{itemize}

\section{Theory}
\subsection{System}
Rotary straightening machines, \cref{straighteningImage2,straighteningImage3,straighteningImage6}, are a finishing machine developed to straighten and improve ovality of a metal pipes. A tube is fed through a series of roller pairs undergoing a series of bending moments inducing controlled plastic deformation to straighten the tubes. Tubes subjected to two straightening forces, pressure straightening and bend (or offset) straightening. Hydraulic actuators are used to precisely position the height of the rollers and at least some are driven by motors which grip and rotate the tube while feeding it through the machine. A number of different configurations for this type of machine exist with six and 10 rolls being common. 

The rollers' profile is not the same as the tube radius but are hyperbolic/parabolic in shape and only contact the tube in 3 places. This shape allows it to accommodate different tube diameters by adjusting the gap or height between the upper and lower rollers as well as the angle between them and the tube. The rollers can be adjusted from parallel to the pipe up to approximately 45 degrees, with the upper rollers being adjusted in opposite angle to lower rollers.

Modern machines are equipped with sensors monitor the amount of force being applied, the deformation of the tube, and other relevant parameters ~\cite{zhang2010study}. This feedback allows the machine to make real-time adjustments to the straightening process for optimal results. These sensors, while controlling the process itself can also be used for condition monitoring purposes.

Significant research exists on the mechanical analysis of such machines ~\cite{kato2014straightening, ma2020effect, ma2021analysis, yu2018theoretical, das1991mechanics, yoshimura2009effect, zhang2019modeling} however there are no studies on the monitoring of such systems using real life data.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
%Why Feature Extraction?
Feature extraction is the process of computing several numerical values from raw signals. Machine learning algorithms suffer from high amounts of data and information redundancy while requiring vast amounts of storage. By  extracting signal features and deciding which are irrelevant one can reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed while still retaining the essence of the signals.

%Feature extraction used in condition monitoring/degradation
Feature extraction techniques are commonly used to estimate degradation trends ~\cite{caesarendra2017review,adams2017comparison,hong2014condition}.
%Types of features
Features can include time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain (temporal) and even model based methods ~\cite{teti2010advanced}. Time-frequency features are examples of three dimensional which include wavelet analysis, spectrograms, scalograms, Wigner-Ville distribution, and kurtograms ~\cite{soualhi2021novel}. Some of the most widely used or effective Time domain indicators are mainly based on  rms value, the crest factor, and kurtosis ~\cite{soualhi2021novel}. ~\cite{d2019physical} even proposes a feature set built on experimental data from sensors plus results from building a simplified kinematic and dynamic model.

Machine \gls{CM} can use various types of sensors including: vibration monitoring, acoustic emission monitoring, a fusion of vibration and acoustic, electric motor current monitoring, oil analysis, thermography ~\cite{ahmed2020condition}. There is no one size fits all when it comes to condition monitoring. For example a for a slewing bearing, a large low-speed heavy-load bearing, vibration signal is insufficient ~\cite{wang2016multiple} and thus fusion models based on torque, temperature and vibration are needed.

\subsection{Time Domain Features} 	
The list of features used for this project are as follows:
\subsubsection*{Coefficient of Determination}
The coefficient of determination, or $R^{2}$ correlation, is a measure of how well a model predicts the actual output values. It is calculated as the one minus the \gls{SSR} divided by \gls{TSS},
\begin{equation}
R^{2} = 1 - \frac{\textrm{SSR}}{\textrm{TSS}} = 1 - \frac{\Sigma(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{\Sigma(y_i - \bar{y_i})^2}. 
\end{equation}
An $R^{2}$ value of 1 means that the two signals are perfectly linear and a value of zero means there is no linear relationship. A value between 0 and 1 indicates some degree of linear relationship exists with the degree of linearity increasing with the value.
\subsubsection*{Mean}
The mean, $ \bar{x} $, is the average value of the signal,
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} x_i}{N},
\end{equation}
where $ x_i $ is the $ i $:th element of the signal and $ N $ is the number of samples in the signal.
\subsubsection*{Standard Deviation}  
The standard deviation, $\sigma$, is the square root of variance, and measures the dispersion of a data set relative to its mean,
\begin{equation}
	\sigma =\sqrt{\frac{\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{(N-1)}}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{\gls{RMS}}
\gls{RMS} is the square root of the mean squared,
\begin{equation}
x_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1}x^2_i}.
\end{equation}
Excessive variation in the rms level usually means a change in health status and possible failure. 
\subsubsection*{Shape Factor}
Root mean square divided by the mean of the absolute value. It is dependent on the signal shape and independent of the 
\begin{equation}
x_{SF} = \frac{ x_{RMS} }  {\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}|x_i|}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Kurtosis}
Kurtosis is derived from the statistical moment of order 4 and is defined as the ratio between the mean value of the signal raised to the power of 4 and the square of its variance, \begin{equation}
x_{kurt} = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^4}{(N-1)\sigma^4}.
\end{equation}
It is a statistical quantity used to analyze the flattening of a distribution and therefore to observe the shape of the signal. It is a astatistical measure of the tailedness of a distribution and indicates the total degree of outliers present. An increase in the number of outliers, and thus an increase in the Kurtosis metric, can be a indication of an impending fault. For normal bearing operation, kurtosis is close to 3 and increases rapidly with faults.
\subsubsection*{Skewness} 
A measure of asymmetry of through probability density function. Faults can sometimes be revealed through asymmetric distribution.
\begin{equation}
x_{skew} = \frac{\sum^2_{i=1}(x_i-m)^3}{(N-1)\sigma^3}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Peak Value}
Maximum value of a signal
\begin{equation}
x_p = \textrm{max}(x_i)
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Impulse Factor} 
The maximum absolute value divided by the mean of absolute value. Comparison of the height of the peak to the average value.
\begin{equation}
x_{IF} = \frac{x_p}{(\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}|x_i|)}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Crest Factor} 
Crest Factor is found by dividing the maximum absolute value of a signal by the \gls{RMS} value,
\begin{equation}
x_{crest} = \frac{x_p}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}\sum^N_{i=1}x^2_i}.
\end{equation}
Faults can often be detected as a peakiness of signals before they become evident in the energy (\gls{RMS}). Other indicators have been developed based on the crest factor, such as the K-factor, by multiplying the peak value by the rms value or the peak-to-peak value, measuring the difference between the amplitudes of the upper and lower peaks ~\cite{soualhi2021novel}.
\subsubsection*{Clearance Factor} 
Peak value divided by the squared mean value of the square roots of the absolute values. For a healthy bearings this feature is maximum and decreases as faults develop.
\begin{equation}
x_{clear} = \frac{x_p}{(\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}\sqrt{|x_i|})^2}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{\gls{SNR}}
Ratio of signal power to noise power in decibels.
\subsubsection*{\gls{SINAD}}
Ratio of total harmonic component power to fundamental power.
\subsubsection*{\gls{THD}}
Ratio of total signal power to total noise-plus-distortion power.
\subsection{Frequency Domain Features}
In order to computer the frequency features one must first compute a power spectrum.
\subsubsection*{Band Power}
The band power is the area beneath the graph, within a frequency range, of the power spectral density vs the frequencies.
the power of a signal in the selected frequency range.
The area under the spectrum curve within the chosen band limits.
\subsubsection*{Peak Amplitude}
Peak amplitude is the height of the maximum frequency value on the power spectrum.
\subsubsection*{Peak Frequency}
Peak frequency is the value of the frequency which has the highest peak.
\subsection{Feature Selection}
Once the features have been calculated the challenge is to isolate the most useful and relevant features. Often data sets contain irrelevant, highly correlated or noisy features that can be removed without a significant loss in information. It is ideal remove non-informative and redundant features to reduce complexity, making models easier to interpret. To this point ~\cite{tolocsi2011classification} argues "that several widely used classification algorithms can generate misleading feature rankings when the training datasets contain large groups of correlated features."

The main task of feature selection is to select a subset of features that are the most relevant to the classification problem. There is no consensus on which feature/combination of features are best suited for the identification of and distinguishing between faults. 


%Techniques for selecting features
This paper talks about defines feature goodness metrics of correlation (Corr), monotonicity (Mon) and robustness (Rob) ~\cite{zhang2016degradation}.

%Automatic feature extraction? Manual Feature extraction?
Acoustic emission signals. Ant colony optimization-based feature selection methods ? ~\cite{liao2010feature}.

This PhD thesis does this.. ~\cite{martin2017unsupervised}

% Best subset selection (forward/backward step-wise selection)
Forward/backward step wise selection.~\cite{james2013introduction}

% Automatic Feature Selection methods
Uses ANOVA F-Test to rank features and do multiclass classification. 
This paper mentions feature selection techniques like ANOVA F-Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Model Importance, Feature Correlation Clustering. 
Feature Correlation Clustering involves using thresholds and removing highly correlation features.
"The work outlines an approach to determining which is the minimum set features that best distinguishes between Healthy and damaged states in bridges"~\cite{buckley2023feature}.

% PCA
"A PCA-based approach to selecting the most representative features for the classification of defective components and defect severity in three types of rolling bearings was developed." "These features were then used as inputs for an unsupervised competitive learning scheme to classify defective bearings according to their defect sizes." ~\cite{malhi2004pca}




\subsection{Linear Regression Models}
Once a subset of has been selected....
As mentioned on earlier, supervised learning involves building a model in order to predict or estimate an output based on one or more inputs. In the case of unsupervised learning, there are one or more inputs but no quantitative outputs. However, one can still learn about relationships between signals and the structure from such data. This is more of an inference task rather than prediction.
By plotting one signal feature against another signal feature relationships in the data can be found. Not only linear relations but quite possibly non-linear relationships too.
Calculating a linear regression model is done using linear least squares, 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:reqression}
	\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T \cdot \mathbf{X})^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{X}^T \cdot \mathbf{Y},
\end{equation}
where $ \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\theta_{1}} \\ \vdots \\ \hat{\theta_{n}} \end{bmatrix} $, $ \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1}(1) & \hdots & x_{k}(1) \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ x_{1}(n) & \hdots & x_{k}(n)  \end{bmatrix}$ and 
$ \mathbf{Y} = \begin{bmatrix} y(1) \\ \vdots \\ y(2)\end{bmatrix}$.\\
Equation \ref{eq:reqression} is used for multivariate models as well a two variable models.
\subsection{Metrics}
% Fit equation from compare function
\begin{equation}
	\textrm{Fit Value} = 100 * \frac{ 1 - \lVert(\mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{\hat{Y}}\rVert } { \lVert \mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{\bar{Y}} \rVert }
\end{equation}

%Some comments on classification?
As alluded to earlier, one challenge in analyzing a real operating machine is the lack of fault data. Many studies are performed in the lab on specially constructed test rigs which are built to run until destruction ~\cite{soualhi2021novel, wang2016multiple, d2019physical}. This is not possible on an operational asset since one cannot afford to run the machine until it fails.

"The multi-feature fusion technique PCA is used to fuse the multi-features to obtain the indicator which can reflect the degradation of slewing bearing effectively in this paper."~\cite{lu2016degradation}

\subsection{Signal Correlations}
An analysis of the raw signals was performed using R\textsuperscript{2} value. Table \ref{correlationTable} shows the R\textsuperscript{2} value for each pair of signals for the first data file with the lower triangle being a replica of the upper triangle. \Cref{fig:RawSignalCorrelationsFile1} plots all of the signals against each other with the R\textsuperscript{2} values in the range of 0.2 to 0.9 printed on the plots.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Pre-processing}
State detection for this application is performed using Signal 5: 21:20 Actual moment under Rolls. When the machine is not actively processing a tube this value is much less than when it is processing a tube. When no tube is in the system there is no or minimal torque on this sensor and when processing it experiences a much larger moment.
The data is separated into cycles using this signal to isolate the periods where the machine is in the act or processing a part. A threshold of 600 was used as the threshold and a threshold of X samples was also used to filter out short pulses which aren't believed to be full cycles.

\Cref{fig:StateDetection} shows the windows that were identified from each file where the 21.20 signal was above the threshold. Two files, B\_30\_03 and B\_04\_04, contained no identified pulses. In total 240 pulses were identified where the 21.20 signal crosses the threshold. Some of these identified pulses were too short and thus believed to be false positives. Any pulse under 500 samples (10 seconds) was removed from the data for the next stage leaving 224 pulses to extract features from.

\Cref{fig:IdentifiedPulses} shows pulses or cycles for the signal 21:20 in each of the fifteen files. As mentioned earlier B\_30\_03 and B\_04\_04 show no pulses as all. All the pulses are around 40 seconds in duration with similar shapes but varying profiles.

    \label{fig:SignalPulses}
\end{figure}

Using the identified pulses, we can look at all the other signals during the same periods. Signal 1: 21.07 Angle over Rolls and 2: 21.10 Position over Rolls are fairly constant though contain some small deviations. Signal 7: 21:31 Width position and  8: 21:32 Height position are also fairly constant but contain some information when zoomed in. Signal 21.35 is a fully constant signal and contains nothing but a single value. The label for this signal is set point so it can be assumed that this is a set point that is controlled by the operator and not as sensor on the machine providing feedback. Apart from using this signal for further separating the data into different categories it's likely not that useful for condition monitoring.

\Cref{fig:SignalPulse5} shows the state detection, Signal 5: Moment under rolls, signal in more detail. Visually one can see these are a type of pulse single with a small amplitude frequency component. Signal 3: Moment over rolls looks like a very similar type of signal. Channel 6, 9, 10 and 11 contain some interesting information that can be used for characterize the machine state.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Feature Selection}
Once the data has been prepossessed and the features calculated then the analysis can begin. Firstly, let us consider a single sensor or channel. Feature values are calculated for each production cycle of this channel. The R\textsuperscript{2} value for each pair of features is computed and they are plotted against each other. This is used as a first stage for filtering out irrelevant data. A small, or zero, R\textsuperscript{2} value indicates that there is a very weak or no linear relationship between that pair of features. On the other hand an R\textsuperscript{2} value of close to 1 indicates that the two features are perfectly or close to perfectly linear. Neither of these feature pairs are of interest as these are not combinations where signals are varying and unlikely to see degradation trends. 

A range of two threshold values are used for this method to select feature pairs. An upper and and a lower R\textsuperscript{2} threshold value reveals feature pairs which are somewhat linear or varying in nature. These are the combinations that are of interest to look for condition indicators.

A semi-automated method can be used to narrow down on feature pairs of interest. An algorithm can cycle through the table of R\textsuperscript{2} values and the features correlated to a number of others can be isolated. Within that combination one can then remove those signals from the group which are highly correlated with each other.

Not only can one compare pairs of feature within the same signal but one can also look for relationships between the same feature in varying channels or sensors. 

MATLAB's Diagnostic Feature Designer was used calculate the features from the signal pulse data with Table \ref{signalNames} showing the features that were extracted. Throughout the remainder of the report some figures are labeled with a feature number instead of the full text due to readability and space constraints. Use Table \ref{signalNames} to refer to which feature the indexes represents.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
\subsubsection*{Feature vs Feature}
%\Cref{fig:FeatureVsFeatureCombinedSignal3} shows an example of plotting all features against one another for signal 1: 21.07 Angle over Rolls. Each number on the diagonal represents a feature starting with the time domain followed by the frequency domain. Only the R\textsuperscript{2} values between 0.3 and 0.8 are printed on the relevant plots. It can be noted that features 1, 2 and 3 all have very straight lines for the plots so here we can say that these features (Clearance, Crest and Impulse Factor), are extremely linear and need only include one of these in a model.
%The colours used in these plots are used to represent pseudo time. Although since the data is only from 1 hour per day the colour spectrum is not linear however it should be good enough to show a trend over time.\\
%Looking at Feature 1 for this channel, it can be seen that the R-square value is within our range when compared with Feature 10 Kurtosis and Feature 11 Skewness.  \Cref{fig:Models_Signal3Feature1} shows these three features plotted against one another for all cycles. As expected they are somewhat similar in pattern but not exactly the same.

\section{Discussion}
%In this chapter the results and the chosen method are discussed, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the work.

%Discuss results and put in context/comparison with references at the beginning. 
This study aimed to give suggestions as to what signals and/or signal features are of value for future condition monitoring studies and which ones are not.

The work performed in this study has been limited to an analysis of the available data. Future work could include the application of machine learning techniques to the signals highlighted in this project. In particular unsupervised learning approaches such as K nearest neighbors or K-means clustering approach.

The data supplied for the project is from a two week period which probably does not give a good insight into the life cycle of the machine. Perhaps a better selection of data would include a snippet of data every 1-2 weeks and thus one could get a better view of how the machine degrades over a year.

The straightening machine in this study produces products of of different diameters. At least one of the signals can be used to indicate this diameter. This could be used to classify the data further into different tube widths. A suggestion for future studies is to perform an additional prepossessing step to separate data into periods where the machine is producing tubes with certain diameters. Some of the clustering suggestions or relationships given in this study could just be identifying when the machine is producing a tube of a certain width. Separating data and focusing on only one tube width would removed any chance of this. A method like this would have been challenging since only 224 pulses were identified to begin with and thus a further reduction might result in not enough data to make meaningful observations.

One conclusion could be that "for future condition monitoring work we need to only focus on this data (might only be 10\%)".\\
Another conclusion could be that we need to go forward to doing this and that.\\
Conclusion could be what we say to the company or what we need.\\
Would temperature of something be good to monitor?\\
Worth doing an analysis based on different sizes
Ideally we would have data over the lifespan of a machine. The data we have right know, we don't know whether is is normal operating data. It could be right at the beginning of the lifecycle or could be just at the end of the machines lifecycle. A system that has been operating for a long period of time will undergo changes due to the natural wear of the system.
One conclusion might be just to discard all the signals with constant values.
These types of analysis can be expanded exponentially but one can only look at so much before moving on. It is also beneficial to, at least begin with, simple things like two variable linear regression.

Since 2017 it is mandatory that all technical reports, theses, and similar publications, discuss Environmental Impact and Sustainability of the project. To find a starting point it is suggested to use “the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Under each goal there are some goal targets listed. Identify one or more goals relevant for your thesis, and comment using relevant goal targets.
It should also be noted that the result and the methods used in this thesis are in good agreement with target 9.5 of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development [52].

\section{Conclusion}
%Here the work should be concluded and the major results presented. Suggestions of continuation and spin-off projects may be brought forward, usually under a separate subsection called “Future Work”.
A study of the available data on a steel tube straightening machine was conducted with regards to using the existing infrastructure for condition monitoring.
\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation was performed on the raw signal data to identify relationships between the sensor channels.
\item The data was prepossessed using an amplitude threshold for the state detection and then a time threshold to eliminate false cycles.
\item Time and frequency domain features were extracted from the cycles.
\item For every sensor channel, each feature was plotted against every other feature and the R\textsuperscript{2} correlation coefficient was calculated.
\item An upper and lower threshold, was used to selected a combination of features that are somewhat correlated but not well perfectly correlated.
\end{itemize}
